# Tot1 Web page
### A work in proges site can be viewed here: https://therealjensjk.github.io/Tot1/

## Feedback needed on:

- Should the **Tot1** text in the header have a "battle scared" font?
- Any other requirements?
- Other?
- **The red text is temporary**

## How to
Give feedback and/or add requirements in the requirements and feedback.txt file. To edit the file;  click on it and there will be a pencil at over the text of the document. If you have an idea for the header image, upload the image to the images folder (note: the same image does not necessarily work on both web and mobile hence in the current version the use two different images). To upload to the images folder; click on the folder, then use the add file button at over the list of existing files.

The work in progress site (the link in the top of the description) can be sheared with others, but due to not wanting to deal with others forking and or modifying the project, the github page is private. If anyone else have any feedback they can tell you and you can modify the requirements and feedback file accordingly, or upload an image for use as the header.

If you fill out the apply form a email will automaticaly be sent to me, if you try to fill it out i will forward the mail to you, so you can se how it looks (the reciver of the email will be modifyed at a later point).

Any bugs can also for the time beeing be added to the requirements and feedback file. (Note: Some functions and alignments of elements are still work in progress and not classified as bugs)
